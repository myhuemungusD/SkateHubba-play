# Branch Protection Rules

This document defines the branch protection rules for the `main` branch. These rules **must** be configured in GitHub → Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules (or via repository rulesets).

## Background

In early 2026, unsupervised AI coding agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) pushed changes directly to `main` that:

1. Rewrote working game logic without approval
2. Added Cloud Functions that were never requested
3. Modified CI workflows without review

The CI pipeline has since been pruned to `build-and-test` only. The rules below prevent this class of incident from recurring.

---

## Required Rules for `main`

Configure these in **GitHub → Settings → Branches → Add rule** (pattern: `main`):

### 1. Require pull request before merging

- **Required approving reviews**: 1
- **Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed**: ✅
- **Require review from Code Owners**: ✅ (see `.github/CODEOWNERS`)
- **Require approval of the most recent reviewable push**: ✅

### 2. Require status checks to pass before merging

- **Require branches to be up to date before merging**: ✅
- **Required status checks**:
  - `build-and-test` (from `.github/workflows/main.yml`)
  - `enforce-pr-policy` (from `.github/workflows/pr-gate.yml`)
  - `verify-no-cloud-functions` (from `.github/workflows/pr-gate.yml`)
  - `validate-firebase-rules` (from `.github/workflows/pr-gate.yml`)

> **Automation:** `scripts/apply-branch-protection.sh` applies all of the
> rules below via `gh api`. Run it whenever this checklist changes so the
> remote repo stays in sync with the documented policy.

### 3. Require conversation resolution before merging

- ✅ All review comments must be resolved

### 4. Do not allow bypassing the above settings

- ✅ Even administrators must follow these rules

### 5. Restrict who can push to matching branches

- Only the repository owner (`@myhuemungusD`) may push directly
- AI agents and bot accounts must go through pull requests

### 6. Block force pushes

- ✅ Do not allow force pushes

### 7. Block deletions

- ✅ Do not allow branch deletion

## Automated Guards (CI-Enforced)

In addition to GitHub's branch protection settings, the following CI checks run on every PR to `main`:

| Check                       | Workflow                    | Purpose                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enforce-pr-policy`         | `pr-gate.yml`               | Confirms the change arrived via PR                                                           |
| `verify-no-cloud-functions` | `pr-gate.yml`               | Rejects new Cloud Functions code in `functions/src/`                                         |
| `verify-workflow-changes`   | `pr-gate.yml`               | Warns when `.github/workflows/` files are modified                                           |
| `validate-firebase-rules`   | `pr-gate.yml`               | Runs emulator rules tests when Firestore/Storage rules change                                |
| `build-and-test`            | `main.yml`                  | Lint, type check, tests, build                                                               |
| `lighthouse`                | `main.yml`                  | Performance regression check                                                                 |
| Rules deploy                | `firebase-rules-deploy.yml` | Pushes `firestore.rules` / `storage.rules` / indexes to production on merge to `main`        |
| Infra setup                 | `firebase-infra-setup.yml`  | Manual workflow for daily Firestore backups + 90-day Storage lifecycle (`workflow_dispatch`) |

## CODEOWNERS

The `.github/CODEOWNERS` file assigns `@myhuemungusD` as the default owner for all files. When "Require review from Code Owners" is enabled, every PR requires their approval.

---

## What AI Agents Must Do

1. **Always work on a feature branch** — never commit directly to `main`
2. **Open a pull request** — all changes must go through PR review
3. **Do not modify CI workflows** without explicit maintainer approval
4. **Do not add Cloud Functions** — the app is a serverless Firebase SPA by design
5. **Do not rewrite existing game logic** without a linked issue and approval

## Setup Checklist

You can apply the entire ruleset in one command:

```bash
GITHUB_REPO=myhuemungusD/skatehubba-play bash scripts/apply-branch-protection.sh
```

Or click through the UI:

- [ ] Go to GitHub → Settings → Branches → Add branch protection rule
- [ ] Set branch name pattern to `main`
- [ ] Enable "Require a pull request before merging"
- [ ] Set required approving reviews to 1
- [ ] Enable "Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed"
- [ ] Enable "Require review from Code Owners"
- [ ] Enable "Require approval of the most recent reviewable push"
- [ ] Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
- [ ] Enable "Require branches to be up to date before merging"
- [ ] Add required status checks: `build-and-test`, `enforce-pr-policy`, `verify-no-cloud-functions`, `validate-firebase-rules`
- [ ] Enable "Require conversation resolution before merging"
- [ ] Enable "Do not allow bypassing the above settings"
- [ ] Enable "Restrict who can push to matching branches" (add `@myhuemungusD`)
- [ ] Disable "Allow force pushes"
- [ ] Disable "Allow deletions"
