## What is S.K.A.T.E.?

S.K.A.T.E. is the skateboarding version of HORSE. One player sets a trick; the other must land it. Miss and you earn a letter — **S**, then **K**, then **A**, then **T**, then **E**. First to spell it out loses.

This app brings that to your phone, async. Set your trick whenever, opponent matches whenever. No need to be at the same spot or online at the same time.

## Features

- **Async gameplay** — players take turns on their own schedule
- **Video tricks** — record one-take videos in-browser (WebM) or native app (MP4)
- **Real-time updates** — both players see game state the moment it changes
- **24-hour turn timer** — games don't stall; expired turns auto-forfeit
- **Google OAuth** — popup sign-in with redirect fallback for mobile/Safari
- **Email verification** — required before play; resend from the app
- **Atomic username reservation** — no two players share a handle (Firestore transaction)
- **Invite & share** — SMS, link copy, native share for invites and trick clips
- **Push notifications** — FCM "your turn" alerts with deep-link into the game
- **Cross-game clips feed** — every landed trick rolls into a global, scrollable feed
- **Featured clip surface** — top of lobby rotates the freshest landed clips
- **Clip upvotes** — single-tap upvote on every clip (no undo, double-vote-proof via Firestore rules)
- **Leaderboard** — ranked players by wins (aspirational targets)
- **Player profiles** — public per-user pages with full game history
- **Block & report** — moderation tools backed by Firestore rules
- **Spots map** — geo-tagged skate spots with gnar rating + bust risk (in progress)
- **Optional judge** — nominate a neutral third player to rule on disputes and "Call BS" (in review)
- **Offline support** — Firestore local cache lets you read games without internet
- **Native apps** — Capacitor builds for iOS and Android
- **PWA-ready** — installable from the browser
- **Security rules** — all game logic validated server-side; client can't cheat scores
- **Cookie-free analytics** — Vercel Analytics with full funnel instrumentation

## Deployment

See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for the full guide. Short version:

1. Create a Firebase project with Auth, Firestore, and Storage enabled
2. Deploy the app to Vercel — import the repo, add env vars, deploy
3. Deploy security rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage`

## Live Demo

**[skatehubba.com](https://skatehubba.com)** — create an account and start a game in under 30 seconds.

## Event Instrumentation & Core Funnel

All analytics flow through a single wrapper (`src/services/analytics.ts`) backed by [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics) — cookie-free, GDPR-safe, zero-config. Swapping providers is a one-file change.

### Instrumented Events

| Event                 | Fires When                                | Properties                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `sign_up`             | New account created                       | `method` (email / google)        |
| `sign_in`             | User logs in                              | `method` (email / google)        |
| `game_created`        | Player creates a new challenge            | `gameId`                         |
| `trick_set`           | Setter records and submits a trick        | `gameId`, `trickName`            |
| `match_submitted`     | Matcher submits their attempt             | `gameId`, `landed` (bool)        |
| `game_completed`      | Game reaches a final state (win/loss)     | `gameId`, `won` (bool)           |
| `video_uploaded`      | Trick video successfully uploaded         | `durationMs`, `sizeBytes`        |
| `invite_sent`         | Player shares an invite link              | `method` (sms / copy / share)    |
| `clip_shared`         | Player shares a trick clip                | `method`, `context`              |
| `clip_saved`          | Player saves a trick clip locally         | `context`                        |
| `game_shared`         | Player shares a completed game            | `context`, `method`              |
| `map_viewed`          | Spots map screen mounts                   | —                                |
| `spot_previewed`      | User taps a spot marker → preview opens   | `spotId`                         |
| `challenge_from_spot` | Challenge screen opened with `?spot=` ref | `spotId`                         |

### Core Funnel

```
sign_up → game_created → trick_set → match_submitted → game_completed
              ▲                              ↓
              │                       invite_sent (viral loop)
              │                              ↓
              │                       clip_shared (content flywheel)
              │
   map_viewed → spot_previewed → challenge_from_spot
                       (spot-driven acquisition path)
```

Each step maps 1:1 to a tracked event. Drop-off between any two stages is visible in the Vercel Analytics dashboard.

## Roadmap: Async Gameplay → Network Effects

For the live, evidence-backed completion table, see [docs/STATUS_REPORT.md](docs/STATUS_REPORT.md).

### Phase 1 — Core Loop ✅ shipped

- Async S.K.A.T.E. gameplay with video proof
- Google OAuth + email auth with verification
- Real-time game state via Firestore snapshots
- 24-hour turn timer with auto-forfeit
- Player profiles with game history

### Phase 2 — Viral Mechanics ✅ shipped

- **Invite flow** — SMS/link/native share to pull friends in (instrumented: `invite_sent`)
- **Clip sharing** — share trick clips to social platforms (instrumented: `clip_shared`)
- **Rematch** — one-tap rematch at game over to keep engagement loops tight
- **Push notifications** — FCM "Your turn" alerts with deep-link into the game

### Phase 3 — Social Graph & Discovery 🟢 mostly shipped

- ✅ **Leaderboard** — ranked players by wins, creating aspirational targets
- ✅ **Player profiles** — public game archives that double as social proof
- ✅ **Challenge anyone** — search/invite by username, expanding beyond existing friend groups
- ✅ **Block & report** — moderation tooling backed by Firestore rules
- ✅ **Cross-game clips feed + featured clip** — landed tricks become a discovery surface
- ✅ **Clip upvotes** — single-tap, no-undo upvotes on every clip (per-vote rules + double-vote guard)
- 🚧 **Vote-driven clip ranking** — promote the feed and featured clip from chronological/random to upvote-ranked (next up)
- 🧊 **Spectator mode** — deferred; revisit after vote-driven ranking lands

### Phase 4 — Network Effects Flywheel 🟡 in progress

- 🚧 **Spot tagging** — geo-tagged trick locations create a skater map (UGC moat) — map UI, spots service, Firestore rules, and rules-tests are landed; final UI polish in progress
- ⏳ **Crew challenges** — team-based S.K.A.T.E. (3v3) multiplies each invite by 6 players
- ⏳ **Trick library** — community trick index with video proof, a defensible content layer
- ⏳ **Tournaments** — bracket-style competitions for appointment engagement

### Unreleased — Judge System 🧑‍⚖️ in review

Optional third player who arbitrates disputes. See `[Unreleased]` in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

- Nominate a judge at challenge time; honor system runs by default if declined or absent
- **Dispute path** — judge rules on a matcher's "landed" claim (24 h, then auto-accept)
- **Call BS path** — matcher can flag the setter's video before attempting (24 h, then set stands)
- New `setReview` phase + `judgeId` / `judgeStatus` / `judgeReviewFor` schema fields
- Honor-system games skip the `disputable` phase entirely — landed swaps roles instantly

**The thesis:** Each game produces shareable video content. Each shared clip is a free acquisition channel. Each new player brings their crew. The game mechanic (asynchronous, video-first) removes the coordination cost that kills most multiplayer apps — you don't need to be online at the same time or at the same spot.
