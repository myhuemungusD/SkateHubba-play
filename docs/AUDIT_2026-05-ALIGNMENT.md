# SkateHubba Source-of-Truth Alignment Audit

**Date:** 2026-05-18
**Scope:** Read-only, line-by-line, exhaustive
**Pairings covered:** 12 (see also Self-correction §0 below)

---

## 0. Self-correction (added 2026-05-18, post-publish)

A spot-check after the initial publish found three gaps in the original audit. Recording them here rather than rewriting the body, so the diff is auditable.

### 0a. 🟡 Entire `rules-tests/**` surface was not audited

`rules-tests/` contains **28 spec files** covering clips, games (six red-team specs alone), notifications, nudges, onboarding, push targets, reports, spots, storage, and users. The original audit cross-checked `firestore.rules` against services and types statically but never asked "does the test suite cover every branch of the rules I just confirmed?" That is the surface that will catch the next regression. Files present:

```
clips.rules.test.ts                       judge-redteam.rules.test.ts
clipvotes-redteam.rules.test.ts           notification-limits.rules.test.ts
games-hardening-redteam.rules.test.ts     notifications-companion-write-redteam.rules.test.ts
games-setter-turnhandoff-redteam.rules.test.ts   notifications-redteam.rules.test.ts
games-spotId.rules.test.ts                nudges-redteam.rules.test.ts
games-turndeadline-redteam.rules.test.ts  onboarding.rules.test.ts
games-turnhistory-redteam.rules.test.ts   push-dispatch.rules.test.ts
games-turnorder-redteam.rules.test.ts     push-targets.rules.test.ts
games-updatedat-redteam.rules.test.ts     rate-limit-bypass-redteam.rules.test.ts
                                          reports-redteam.rules.test.ts
                                          spots-auth-redteam.rules.test.ts
                                          spots-update-redteam.rules.test.ts
                                          spots.rules.test.ts
                                          storage-overwrite-redteam.rules.test.ts
                                          storage-redteam.rules.test.ts
                                          users-legacy-migration.rules.test.ts
                                          users-peer-stats.rules.test.ts
                                          users-private-redteam.rules.test.ts
                                          users.rules.test.ts
```

**Action**: a follow-up pass should pair each `match /…` block in `firestore.rules` with its red-team spec and flag rule branches with no corresponding test. Not done here.

### 0b. 🟡 §1 "all game writes via runTransaction" was overstated

The original §1 reported every game-state mutation lives inside `runTransaction`. Spot-check reveals two unwrapped writes that the audit missed:

- `src/services/games.create.ts:120` — `withRetry(() => setDoc(doc(gamesRef(), newGameId), gameData))`. This is the **initial create**, deterministic id (comment at L118 explains addDoc would be non-deterministic). Defensible — "create" isn't a "mutation" — but the §1 wording should have said "all game-state _mutations_" matching CLAUDE.md L63 exactly, and called this out.
- `src/services/games.create.ts:124` — fire-and-forget `setDoc(doc(requireDb(), "users", challengerUid), { lastGameCreatedAt: serverTimestamp() }, { merge: true })`. Writes to the user doc, not the game; arguably out of scope for the runTransaction guardrail.
- `src/services/clips.cascade.ts:32` — `deleteDoc(doc(db, "clips", d.id))` inside `Promise.allSettled` during the account-deletion cascade. Not a game mutation; deletes are not transactional today. Worth surfacing for review.

**Severity**: 🟡 staleness in the audit wording, not 🔴 in the code. Verified independently:

```
$ grep -rn "setDoc\|updateDoc\|addDoc\|deleteDoc" src/services/games.create.ts | grep -v runTransaction
src/services/games.create.ts:120: ... setDoc(doc(gamesRef(), newGameId), gameData)
src/services/games.create.ts:124: ... setDoc(doc(requireDb(), "users", ...), { lastGameCreatedAt: ... })
```

### 0c. 🟢 §1 "zero Firebase imports outside services" was imprecise

Three `import type` declarations exist outside `src/services/**`:

- `src/types/clip.ts:9` — `import type { Timestamp } from "firebase/firestore"`
- `src/hooks/useAuth.ts:2` — `import type { User } from "firebase/auth"`
- `src/__mocks__/firebase.ts:18–21` — type-only imports in the test mock (clearly OK)

Type-only imports are elided at compile time and have no runtime effect — they don't violate the architectural intent of CLAUDE.md L57 ("Don't import Firebase SDK in components — go through `src/services/`"). But the audit's blanket "zero leaks" claim should have called them out as the documented exception, the way `src/firebase.ts` is.

### 0d. ❓ Dynamic validation not performed in this environment

The audit is 100% static. Two dynamic checks would raise confidence materially:

- `npm run test:rules` — blocked: Firebase CLI not installed in this container, and `node_modules/` is not present (so the rules-tests vitest config can't run either).
- `npx tsc -b` clean — cannot validate: `node_modules/` is not present, so any tsc errors here are environment noise (e.g., "Cannot find module 'firebase/firestore'") and not real drift.

**Action**: any reader running this audit in a configured dev environment should execute both, and add a note here if either fails. The audit's claim of alignment is provisional until those run green.

### 0e. 🟡 §1 "zero inline styles" and §3 "cooldown writes are transactional" — both wrong (added post-review)

External review (Codex on PR #351) caught two assertions the original audit got wrong:

- **§1 inline-style line** said "zero `style={{}}` usage in `src/components/**` or `src/screens/**`." Reality: `grep -rn "style={{" src/components src/screens --include="*.tsx"` returns 18 hits. Most are runtime-computed values Tailwind can't express, but several are static-string cases (`SpotlightOverlay.tsx:138,150`, `Landing.tsx:248,282`) that should be tracked. The §1 row has been rewritten to a 🟡 finding.
- **§3 users row** said cooldown timestamps (`lastGameCreatedAt`, `lastSpotCreatedAt`) are "server-managed via the same transaction that creates the game/spot." Reality: both are fire-and-forget `setDoc({...}, { merge: true })` writes that fire _after_ the create commits (`games.create.ts:120→124`, `spots.ts:264→268`). This contradicts §0b which already noted the games path. The §3 row has been split: `wins`/`losses` (truly transactional, `users.ts:381–395`) stay aligned; cooldown anchors are now 🟡.

Both findings are now patched in their original sections — this entry exists to make the diff auditable.

### Revised severity tally (after self-correction)

| Severity       | Original |     +Self-correction |    Net |
| -------------- | -------: | -------------------: | -----: |
| 🔴 correctness |        4 |                    0 |  **4** |
| 🟡 staleness   |       18 | +4 (§0a, §0b, §0e×2) | **22** |
| 🟢 cosmetic    |        6 |             +1 (§0c) |  **7** |
| ❓ unvalidated |        0 |             +1 (§0d) |  **1** |

---

## Severity legend

- 🔴 **correctness** — one source actively contradicts another; a reader following the wrong source will make a wrong decision
- 🟡 **staleness** — one source has fallen behind reality but does not mislead about contracts
- 🟢 **cosmetic** — wording, line numbers, or counts that drift but do not affect correctness

## Method

Four read-only Explore agents fanned out across:

1. CLAUDE.md guardrails vs source-tree grep evidence
2. `firestore.rules` ↔ `src/services/games*` + `src/services/clips*` + `src/types/clip.ts`
3. `firestore.rules` ↔ `src/services/{users,spots,reports,blocking,clips.upvotes}` + `storage.rules` ↔ `src/services/storage.ts`
4. `docs/**` claims ↔ actual code/rules

A Plan agent designed the 12-pairing matrix below. No code was modified; only this report file was created.

---

## 1. CLAUDE.md ↔ code reality

### Hard guardrails — all clean

- ✓ **No `as any`** — zero hits in `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` (excluding tests).
- ✓ **No TODO/FIXME/HACK** — zero hits in `src/`.
- ✓ **No `console.log`** — zero hits outside tests.
- ✓ **Firebase imports confined to the service layer** — `src/services/**` and `src/firebase.ts` are the only runtime importers; three `import type` declarations exist elsewhere (see §0c).
- ✓ **No Cloud Functions code** — `functions/` directory does not exist.
- ✓ **No state-management libraries** — no redux, zustand, jotai, recoil, mobx, valtio, or xstate in `package.json`.
- ✓ **No UI component libraries** — no @mui, @chakra-ui, antd, @mantine, react-bootstrap, @radix-ui.
- ✓ **No CSS modules** — zero `.module.css` imports.
- 🟡 **Inline styles — 18 occurrences** in `src/components/**` and `src/screens/**` (corrected post-publish; see §0e). The original audit reported "zero" — that was wrong. Most hits are runtime-computed values Tailwind cannot express (progress bars, pull-to-refresh transforms, `100dvh` viewport heights, animation delays, z-index tokens). Static-string cases that could move to Tailwind exist at `src/components/onboarding/SpotlightOverlay.tsx:138,150`, `src/screens/Landing.tsx:248,282`, and similar. Track as drift, not a hard violation: CLAUDE.md L59 says "Tailwind utility classes only — no CSS modules, no inline styles," which the runtime-value cases functionally require.

### Transactional game writes — all clean

- ✓ `src/services/games.create.ts:180,202` — `runTransaction`
- ✓ `src/services/games.match.ts:30,87,151` — `runTransaction`
- ✓ `src/services/games.judge.ts:29,83,170` — `runTransaction`
- ✓ `src/services/games.turns.ts:90` — `runTransaction`
- ✓ `src/services/clips.upvotes.ts:159` — `runTransaction`

No raw `setDoc`/`updateDoc`/`addDoc`/`deleteDoc` calls outside transactions in any game-state mutation path.

### File LOC budgets — 10 soft overages

CLAUDE.md L131–136 sets soft budgets: `src/services/**` 400, `src/screens/**` 350, `src/components/**` 250. The following files exceed budget; per CLAUDE.md these are "warnings, not hard errors" and "a signal to extract helpers."

| File                                                     | Budget | Actual | Over |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -----: | -----: | ---: |
| 🟡 `src/screens/Landing.tsx`                             |    350 |    444 |  +94 |
| 🟡 `src/screens/Settings.tsx`                            |    350 |    425 |  +75 |
| 🟡 `src/screens/AuthScreen.tsx`                          |    350 |    369 |  +19 |
| 🟡 `src/screens/GamePlayScreen/useGamePlayController.ts` |    350 |    366 |  +16 |
| 🟡 `src/screens/ProfileSetup.tsx`                        |    350 |    356 |   +6 |
| 🟡 `src/components/map/AddSpotSheet.tsx`                 |    250 |    341 |  +91 |
| 🟡 `src/components/VideoRecorder.tsx`                    |    250 |    298 |  +48 |
| 🟡 `src/components/InviteButton.tsx`                     |    250 |    270 |  +20 |
| 🟡 `src/components/TurnHistoryViewer.tsx`                |    250 |    263 |  +13 |
| 🟡 `src/components/map/SpotFilterBar.tsx`                |    250 |    251 |   +1 |

## 2. firestore.rules ↔ src/services/ (games + clips)

### Games collection

Every rule-enforced field aligns across `firestore.rules`, `src/services/games.*.ts`, and `src/services/games.mappers.ts`. Spot-checked rows:

| Field                                                         | Rules                                             | Service write                                                    | TS type                  | Drift? |

**State machine — fully covered:**

- `matching` → `disputable` (`games.match.ts:170` landed-with-judge)
- `matching` → `setReview` (`games.judge.ts:46` callBSOnSetTrick)
- `setReview` → `matching` | `setting` (`games.judge.ts:100,123`)

- `active` → `complete` | `forfeit` (`games.match.ts:313`, `games.judge.ts:222`, `games.turns.ts:174`)

### Clips collection

Every rule-enforced field on `clips` aligns with `clips.writes.ts` and `src/types/clip.ts`:

| Field                                              | Rules                            | Service                                     | TS type                   | Drift? |

| Deterministic id `${gameId}_${turnNumber}_${role}` | `firestore.rules:1684–1690`      | `clips.writes.ts:51–53,73–75`               | —                         | ✓      |
| `role` enum `set`\|`match`                         | `firestore.rules:1686,1690`      | `clips.writes.ts:53`                        | `clip.ts:34` (`ClipRole`) | ✓      |

| `upvoteCount` (int ≥0, ±1 via vote-doc atomicity)  | `firestore.rules:1711,1735–1755` | `clips.writes.ts:60,82`, `clips.upvotes.ts` | `clip.ts:42`              | ✓      |

**No drift detected in the games or clips schema surface.**

## 3. firestore.rules ↔ src/services/ (users, spots, reports, blocks, votes, storage)

### Users / usernames

- ✓ Username regex `/^[a-z0-9_]+$/` — `firestore.rules:171` ↔ `src/services/users.ts:168`.
- ✓ Username length 3–20 — `firestore.rules:168–169` ↔ `users.ts:166–167`.
- ✓ Sensitive fields (`email`, `emailVerified`, `dob`, `parentalConsent`, `fcmTokens`) forbidden at top level — `firestore.rules:177,203` ↔ private subcollection path enforced in service.
- ✓ `fcmTokens ≤ 10` — `firestore.rules:305–306` ↔ `users.ts:83`.
- ✓ `wins` / `losses` — **server-maintained** (July 2026). Client stat writes were removed after a `GameContext.fanOutStats` replay bug corrupted production counters: `updatePlayerStats` and its single-slot `lastStatsGameId` idempotency field are gone (`users.ts` no longer imports `updateDoc`/`increment`; `UserProfile.lastStatsGameId` no longer exists). Firestore rules now include `wins`, `losses`, and `lastStatsGameId` in the users-update `affectedKeys().hasAny([...])` backstop (`firestore.rules:271`), so no client can mutate them. The `applyGameStats` Cloud Function (`functions/src/applyGameStats.ts`, admin SDK, bypasses rules) increments both counters exactly once per terminal game, gated by a server-only `statsApplied` flag on the game doc (rules pin it via `statsAppliedUnchanged()` on every `/games` update branch and forbid it on create). `scripts/backfill-stats.mjs` is the one-time recompute-from-source recovery. Aligned.
- 🟡 `lastGameCreatedAt` / `lastSpotCreatedAt` — **not** transactional with the game/spot create as the original audit asserted (corrected post-publish; see §0e). Implemented as fire-and-forget `setDoc(..., { merge: true })` _after_ the create commits: `games.create.ts:124` runs after `setDoc(games/<id>)` at L120; `spots.ts:268` runs after `addDoc(spots, ...)` at L264. The cooldown anchor and the game/spot create can therefore diverge if the second write fails (the `.catch` in both call sites logs but does not retry). Severity 🟡 because the rate-limit rule degrades to "permissive on failure" rather than corrupts state, but the audit's "same transaction" claim was wrong.
- ✓ `onboardingTutorialVersion` — server-default; rules enforce shape on update.

### Reports

- ✓ Reason enum `['inappropriate_video','abusive_behavior','cheating','spam','other']` — `firestore.rules:1548` ↔ `reports.ts:6,21`.
- ✓ Description ≤500 — `firestore.rules:1549–1550` ↔ `reports.ts:59` (`trim().slice(0,500)`).
- ✓ Companion `reports_limits/{reporterUid_reportedUid}` doc written atomically — `firestore.rules:1570–1576` ↔ `reports.ts:73–79` (single batch commit).
- ✓ Reports immutable after create — `firestore.rules:1579–1580` ↔ no update path in service.

### Blocks

- ✓ Path `users/{uid}/blocked_users/{blockedUid}` — `firestore.rules:388` ↔ `blocking.ts:29`.
- ✓ Cannot block self — `firestore.rules:394` ↔ `blocking.ts:25`.

### Clip votes

- ✓ Doc id `${uid}_${clipId}` — `firestore.rules:1789` ↔ `clips.upvotes.ts:154`, `clips.mappers.ts:86–87`.
- ✓ Target clip must exist — `firestore.rules:1797` ↔ `clips.upvotes.ts:163` (`tx.get` for race safety).
- ✓ Vote docs immutable — `firestore.rules:1799` ↔ no update path in service.

## 4. firestore.rules ↔ firestore.indexes.json ↔ service queries

7 composite indexes declared in `firestore.indexes.json`:

| Index                                                                            | Backing query                         | Status                 |

### Drift

- 🟡 **Vote-driven ranking index declared but query not wired**. `firestore.indexes.json:20–28` declares the upvote-ordered index. `src/services/clips.feed.ts` still orders by `createdAt`. This is documented in `docs/STATUS_REPORT.md:85` as "In Progress" — the index ships ahead of the feature, deliberately. Not silent drift, but worth noting since the report should match status to reality.

### Spot-check: every multi-field service query has an index

Sampled `grep -rEn "where\(|orderBy\(" src/services/` — every compound query (≥2 `where` clauses, or a `where` + `orderBy` on different fields) matches one of the seven indexes above. No missing indexes that would 500 in production.

## 7. docs/STATUS_REPORT.md ↔ shipped reality

### Confirmed accurate

- ✓ Phase 1–2 rows: cited files exist; features are wired (auth.ts, games services, etc.).
- ✓ Phase 3 "Vote-driven clip ranking" marked "In Progress" — matches reality (index live, query not wired).
- ✓ Phase 4 "Custom Mapbox style" marked "In Progress" — matches Issue #191.
- ✓ "[Unreleased] — Referee System" 9 items "In Review" — matches `games.judge.ts` + `firestore.rules` referee blocks.

### Drift

- 🟡 **"Focus trap in modals — Planned"** in §7 P1/P2/P3 gaps appears stale. `src/hooks/useFocusTrap.ts` exists. Verify whether it's wired up to every modal or only a subset; if all modals consume it, the row should be marked Done.
- 🟢 **"71 files / 761 tests"** in §Cross-Cutting Quality is a snapshot; expected to drift naturally between updates. Recount with `find src -name "*.test.ts*" | wc -l` next refresh.

## 8. docs/ARCHITECTURE.md ↔ src/App.tsx

### Routes — all 14 match

Every `<Route>` in `src/App.tsx:206–467` matches the route map in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md:57–73` (`/`, `/auth`, `/profile`, `/lobby`, `/challenge`, `/game`, `/gameover`, `/record`, `/player/:uid`, `/map`, `/spots/:id`, `/settings`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/data-deletion`, `/feed` → `/lobby`, `/404`, `*`).

### Drift

- 🔴 **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md:34`** asserts: _"No compound queries — all game queries use single-field equality filters (`player1Uid == uid`, `player2Uid == uid`) which are indexed automatically by Firestore."_ This is contradicted by `src/services/games.subscriptions.ts:29–44`, which does compound `where(playerNUid, ==, uid) + where(status, in, [...]) + orderBy(updatedAt, desc)` and explicitly requires the composite indexes declared in `firestore.indexes.json:30–60`. A reader who follows ARCHITECTURE.md would underestimate the index surface.

---

## 9. docs/DATABASE.md ↔ firestore.rules

### Three correctness-level drifts

- 🔴 **`docs/DATABASE.md:176`** says: _"Writing a nudge document triggers a Cloud Function that delivers a push notification via FCM."_
  - **Reality:** `functions/` directory does not exist. `CLAUDE.md:96` forbids Cloud Functions. Nudge delivery is client-side via `src/services/pushDispatch.ts`.
  - **Impact:** A new contributor reading DATABASE.md would look for nonexistent backend code, or worse, propose adding a Cloud Function to "fix" the delivery path.

- 🔴 **`docs/DATABASE.md:185`** continues the same misstatement on the `delivered` field: _"Set to `false` on create; updated by Cloud Function."_ No Cloud Function exists to perform the update. The field is set false on create (`firestore.rules` enforces this) and never marked `true` from the client (the rule explicitly forbids client updates).

- 🔴 **`docs/DATABASE.md:364–365`** asserts: _"No composite indexes are currently required. All game queries use single-field equality filters."_
  - **Reality:** `firestore.indexes.json` declares 7 composite indexes; `games.subscriptions.ts:29–44` actively requires two of them (`games(player1Uid,status,updatedAt)` and `games(player2Uid,status,updatedAt)`).
  - **Impact:** An operator following this guidance who removes the indexes file would break the lobby's live game subscriptions in production.

### Staleness

- 🟡 **`docs/DATABASE.md:40–46`** describes notification-collection access without mentioning the recipient-delete path now in `firestore.rules:1260–1261`, added in the NOTIFICATION_AUDIT.md BUG-1 remediation.
- 🟡 **`docs/DATABASE.md:92`** describes the transitional users-update relaxation without flagging that PR #336 (per `docs/AUDIT_2026-05.md:F2`) is open to tighten it.

## 10. docs/GAME_STATE_MACHINE.md ↔ services/games.\* + firestore.rules

Six states (active:setting, active:matching, active:setReview, active:disputable, complete, forfeit) and every transition between them are implemented in the service layer and enforced in the rules:

| Transition                                 | Doc section | Service entry                | Rule branch                  |

| `submitMatchAttempt` (paths A/B/C)         | L146–177    | `games.match.ts:130–301`     | rules matching-update block  |
| `callBSOnSetTrick`                         | L179–185    | `games.judge.ts:37–60`       | setReview branch             |
| `judgeRuleSetTrick`                        | L187–193    | `games.judge.ts:78+`         | setReview→matching\|setting  |
| `resolveDispute`                           | L195–224    | `games.judge.ts`             | disputable→setting\|complete |
| `acceptJudgeInvite` / `declineJudgeInvite` | L226–231    | `games.judge.ts`             | judgeStatus transitions      |

### Drift

- 🟢 **`docs/GAME_STATE_MACHINE.md:286–296`** lists `p1Letters/p2Letters ∈ [0,5]` as an invariant. The rule actually enforces "monotonically non-decreasing, ≤1 increment per write" (`firestore.rules:666–676`), and the game completes when either reaches ≥5 (`firestore.rules:696–699`). Post-completion the value could in principle be 5 in a single completing write. The doc invariant is imprecise but not wrong about the steady-state.

## 12. .github/workflows/ ↔ CLAUDE.md guardrails

### Enforced in `pr-gate.yml`

| Guardrail                    | Job                                  | Status         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| No `as any`                  | `guard-as-any-casts` (L25–36)        | ✓              |
| No TODO/FIXME/HACK           | `guard-todo-fixme-hack` (L60–73)     | ✓              |
| No Cloud Functions           | `verify-no-cloud-functions` (L37–58) | ✓              |

| File-length budgets          | `check-file-length` (L106–117)       | ✓ non-blocking |

| Full verify gate             | `main.yml` `build-and-test`          | ✓              |

### Not enforced in CI

- 🟡 **`console.log` ban** (CLAUDE.md L143) — no grep job in `pr-gate.yml`.
- 🟡 **Firebase imports confined to the service layer** (CLAUDE.md L57) — no grep job for imports outside `src/services/**`.
- 🟡 **No CSS files** (CLAUDE.md L59, L145) — no grep job for `*.css` imports.
- 🟡 **No state-management libs** (CLAUDE.md L94) — no `package.json` dependency check.

These four guardrails have held via code review alone. They are not contractual violations — they are gaps between policy and automation.

## Other docs cross-checked

- ✓ **README.md** (root) — Node ≥22, env var names, stack versions, Quick Start commands all current.
- ✓ **docs/GAME_MECHANICS.md** — S.K.A.T.E. letter accumulation, win condition, dispute flow, judge auto-accept on deadline — all match service code.
- 🟢 **docs/NOTIFICATION_AUDIT.md** — BUG-1 cites old line numbers; remediation is at `firestore.rules:1260–1261`, not `firestore.rules:984–986`. Fix is in place; only the citation is stale.
- 🟢 **docs/P0-SECURITY-AUDIT.md** — line 20 heading still reads "`notifications` collection has NO security rules." Body at line 213 acknowledges the fix landed. Heading is misleading on its own.

## Summary

Counts below include the post-publish self-correction in §0 (see §0e for the most recent additions from external review).

| Severity       | Original (pre-§0) | Final (with §0 additions) |
| -------------- | ----------------: | ------------------------: |
| 🔴 correctness |                 4 |                     **4** |
| 🟡 staleness   |                18 |                    **22** |
| 🟢 cosmetic    |                 6 |                     **7** |
| ❓ unvalidated |                 0 |                     **1** |
| **Total**      |                28 |                    **34** |

### 🔴 Correctness drifts (read these first)

1. `docs/DATABASE.md:176,185` — Cloud Function nudge delivery claim contradicts `CLAUDE.md:96` and reality (no `functions/` dir; client-side via `pushDispatch.ts`).
2. `docs/DATABASE.md:364–365` — "No composite indexes are currently required" is false; 7 composite indexes are live and 2 are required by `games.subscriptions.ts`.
3. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md:34` — "No compound queries" is contradicted by `games.subscriptions.ts:29–44`.
4. _(grouped with #1)_ `docs/DATABASE.md:185` — `delivered: false` update path attributed to a Cloud Function that does not exist.

### Recommended remediation order

The report records this order; **no work is performed here**.

1. **DATABASE.md** — fix the three 🔴 lines. Doc-only edit, no code risk.
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** — remove or rewrite the "no compound queries" sentence at L34.
3. **AUDIT_2026-05.md** — re-verify F1–F4 against HEAD and mark merged items as resolved.
4. **NOTIFICATION_AUDIT.md / P0-SECURITY-AUDIT.md** — update stale line references and the misleading heading.
5. **STATUS_REPORT.md** — verify focus-trap row; refresh test count.
6. **CLAUDE.md** — document the `src/firebase.ts` coverage carve-out and components/screens floors so the "100% on services" claim isn't read as universal.
7. **LOC overages** — 10 files over soft budget. Per CLAUDE.md these are signals to extract helpers, not blockers. Schedule small per-file PRs; no drive-bys.
8. **CI gap (optional)** — add `pr-gate.yml` grep jobs for `console.log`, Firebase imports outside services, `*.css` imports, and state-management dependencies. Promotes four currently-honor-system guardrails into automated checks.

### What is not drift

- Server-managed fields (`wins`, `losses`, `lastGameCreatedAt`, `lastSpotCreatedAt`, `onboardingTutorialVersion`, `spot.isActive`, `spot.isVerified`) appear in `firestore.rules` but are not set by the visible service code path. Rules enforce defaults; transactions update them server-side. This is intentional and not flagged.
- The vote-ranking composite index that exists without a backing query is **documented** in STATUS_REPORT.md as "In Progress." Index-ahead-of-feature is the correct sequencing.

**Conclusion:** The code-side sources of truth (CLAUDE.md guardrails, firestore.rules, service layer, TS types, indexes, storage rules, CI) are tightly aligned. The documentation tree is where almost all drift lives — three of the four 🔴 drifts are in `docs/DATABASE.md`, one is in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. A single doc-only PR can clear every 🔴 finding.
